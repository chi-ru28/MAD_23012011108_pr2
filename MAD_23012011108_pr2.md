AIM: Create Android Application to demonstrate functions of Activity Life Cycle and Basic UI.<br>
<b>Describe :</b> The Android application demonstrates the Activity Life Cycle along with a basic user interface (UI). The project is designed to show how different lifecycle methods (onCreate(), onStart(), onResume(), onPause(), onStop(), onRestart(), and onDestroy()) are invoked as the activity transitions through different states.<br>
The app uses Toast messages or Logcat outputs to indicate which lifecycle method is currently executing. Additionally, the application includes a basic UI layout with components such as TextView, Button, and EditText, allowing the user to interact with the app while observing lifecycle changes when performing actions like opening, closing, or rotating the screen.<br>
This helps developers and learners understand the flow of activity states and how Android manages applications in the background, while also giving hands-on practice with UI design and event handling.<br><br>
